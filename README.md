    }
  ]
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. User selects a quiz category from the home screen
2. App makes HTTP GET request to Open Trivia Database
3. API returns 10 multiple-choice questions in JSON format
4. App parses JSON and extracts question data
5. HTML entities are decoded for clean display
6. Incorrect and correct answers are shuffled randomly
7. Questions displayed one at a time to the user
8. App tracks correct answers throughout the quiz
9. Final score calculated at the end

**Key Features:**
- Located in `TriviaApiService.kt`
- Uses Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous networking
- Implements comprehensive error handling
- Custom HTML entity decoder for clean text display

        "original": {
          "url": "https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7abGQa0aRJUurpII/giphy.gif",
          "width": "480",
          "height": "270"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. Quiz completes and score is calculated
2. If score ‚â• 70%, app triggers GIF request
3. Random search term selected (celebration, success, winner, etc.)
4. App makes HTTP GET request to Giphy API
5. API returns 20 appropriate GIFs
6. App randomly selects one GIF from results
7. Animated GIF displayed on results screen
8. Provides visual reward and motivation

**Key Features:**
- Located in `GiphyApiService.kt`
- Randomized search terms for variety
- G-rated content filter (appropriate for students)
- Graceful degradation (app works if API fails)
- Conditional display based on performance
- Coil library for efficient GIF rendering

## üöÄ Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: HTML Entity Decoding
**Problem:**  
Questions from Open Trivia Database contained HTML entities like `&quot;`, `&#039;`, `&amp;`, making text unreadable.

**Example:**
```
Raw: "What&#039;s the capital of France?"
Displayed: "What's the capital of France?"
```

**Solution:**  
Created custom `decodeHtml()` function in `TriviaApiService.kt` that replaces common HTML entities with their character equivalents before displaying questions to users.

**Code:**
```kotlin
private fun decodeHtml(text: String): String {
    return text.replace("&quot;", "\"")
               .replace("&amp;", "&")
               .replace("&#039;", "'")
               // ... more replacements
}
```

---

### Challenge 2: Answer Randomization
**Problem:**  
API returns correct answer separately from incorrect answers. Without shuffling, the correct answer always appeared in the same position, making quizzes predictable.

**Solution:**  
Combined correct and incorrect answers into a single list, then used Kotlin's built-in `.shuffled()` function to randomize order before displaying.

**Code:**
```kotlin
val allAnswers = (incorrectAnswers + correctAnswer).shuffled()
```

---

### Challenge 3: Network Error Handling
**Problem:**  
App crashed when API was unreachable, user had no internet, or requests timed out. Poor user experience.

**Solution:**  
Implemented comprehensive error handling:
- Wrapped all network calls in try-catch blocks
- Added 15-second timeouts using coroutines
- Return empty lists on failure
- Show loading states to users
- GIF API failure doesn't break app (graceful degradation)

**Code:**
```kotlin
try {
    connection.connectTimeout = 15000
    connection.readTimeout = 15000
    // ... network call
} catch (e: Exception) {
    e.printStackTrace()
    emptyList()
}
```

---

### Challenge 4: GIF Loading Performance
**Problem:**  
Large animated GIFs caused lag on older devices, poor user experience during results screen.

**Solution:**  
Used Coil image loading library with:
- Efficient GIF rendering engine
- Automatic memory management
- Lazy loading
- Graceful fallback if GIF fails to load

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
AsyncImage(
    model = gifUrl,
    contentDescription = "Celebration",
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().height(200.dp)
)
```

---

### Challenge 5: State Management Complexity
**Problem:**  
Managing state across three screens (categories, quiz, results) became complex. Risk of UI and data getting out of sync.

**Solution:**  
Implemented MVVM architecture with StateFlow:
- Single source of truth in ViewModel
- Reactive UI updates automatically
- Clean separation of concerns
- Testable business logic
- Type-safe state transitions

**Architecture:**
```kotlin
data class UiState(
    val screen: Screen,
    val questions: List<Question>,
    val score: Int,
    // ... more state
)

val uiState: StateFlow<UiState>
```

---

### Challenge 6: Kotlin 2.0 Compose Compiler
**Problem:**  
Kotlin 2.0+ requires explicit Compose Compiler plugin, causing build failures with older configurations.

**Solution:**  
Added Compose Compiler plugin to build.gradle.kts:
```kotlin
id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose") version "2.0.21"
```

---
